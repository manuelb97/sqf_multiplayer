database
    need better database for each mission 
		for liberation_rpg: bases cleared, amount of enemies reduced per zone, xp lost due to death with equipment x
    keep main event handler for kills, deaths 
    implement separate systems for mission sub types 
        e.g. pvp attacker / defender wins, buildings cleared etc

check advanced ballistics code 
    write function to provide exact shooting solution 
        calc own solution, compare -> better feedback on what underestimated

check input for each function to be sure errors dont occur because of input 
    [_varArr, _typeArr] call bia_check_input;

    need to be able to specify variable type present in array variables 

    [[_dist, _dir, _rounds, _radius]] call bia_to_num params ["_dist", "_dir", "_rounds", "_radius"];
    _valid = [_parent, _player, _pos, _rounds, _radius] isEqualTypeParams ["", objNull, [], 0, 0];
    if !(_valid) exitWith
    {
        ["scripts\support\artillery\he_small_barrage.sqf", _parent, [_parent, _pos, _rounds, _radius]] spawn bia_input_msg;
    };

revive side missions
    overall 
        smaller scale than before 
        enemy proximity patrols higher pressure, less on site 
    push through
        infinite proximity enemy spawn
        goal reach end zone from start zone 
    old side missions 
        destroy enemey supplies etc 

implement global variable to adjust all supports & equipment
    kits
        check loadouts from previous missions 
    supports 
        rebel
            mortar 80mm HE, Smoke

    at supports like sniper support?
        spawn javelin missile to take vehicle out?
            check for vehicles in designated area
            if found execute script
